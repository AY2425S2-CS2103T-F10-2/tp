## Tips for Effective Use

## Command summary

2. **Tagging Strategy**
   - Use consistent tags across households for better organization
   - Consider tags for case type (e.g., `financial`, `medical`, `housing`)
   - Use tags for priority levels (e.g., `urgent`, `follow-up`, `completed`)
   - Add tags for special needs (e.g., `elderly`, `children`, `disability`)

3. **Session Planning**
   - Schedule sessions at least 30 minutes apart to allow for travel time
   - Add detailed notes immediately after sessions while details are fresh
   - Use the list-sessions command to review your upcoming schedule

4. **Data Management**
   - Regularly back up your data file (located at `data/householdbook.json`)
   - Consider creating separate backups for different periods (monthly/quarterly)
   - Review and clean up old or completed cases periodically

5. **Efficient Workflows**
   - Group visits by geographic area to minimize travel time
   - Use the find-household command with area names to identify nearby cases
   - Add time estimates to session notes for better future planning

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I import data from other case management systems?**  
A: Currently, Em-Social doesn't support direct imports. You'll need to manually enter household information.

**Q: How many households can Em-Social handle?**  
A: Em-Social can efficiently manage hundreds of households, though performance may decrease with extremely large datasets (1000+).

**Q: Is my data secure?**  
A: Em-Social stores all data locally on your computer. No data is sent to external servers. For sensitive data, ensure your computer is secured with a password and consider encrypting your drive.

**Q: Can multiple social workers use Em-Social simultaneously?**  
A: Em-Social is designed for individual use. For team settings, each social worker should use their own instance of the application.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally delete a household?**  
A: Unfortunately, there's no built-in recovery for deleted households. This is why Em-Social asks for confirmation before deletion. Consider regular backups of your data file.

**Q: Can I customize the fields for households?**  
A: The current version has fixed fields. Future versions may include customizable fields based on user feedback.

**Q: How do I report bugs or request features?**  
A: Please submit issues on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/issues).
