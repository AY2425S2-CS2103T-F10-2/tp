   Make sure you have Java `17` or a newer version installed on your computer. To check your Java version, open your terminal and type:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
   If Java is not installed, or you have an older version, download and install the latest version from [this link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html).

2. **Download Em-Social**  
   Download the latest release of Em-Social from the [Em-Social releases page](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/releases). Look for the latest `em-social.jar` file in the list of assets.

3. **Save the Downloaded File**  
   Move the downloaded `em-social.jar` file to the folder where you want to keep Em-Social. This could be your Desktop or a dedicated folder for the application.

    - **macOS:** Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press `Enter`.
    - **Linux:** Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

    - **Windows:**
      ```bash
      cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\Em-Social
      ```
    - **macOS/Linux:**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface Overview

![User Interface with Labels](images/labeled-ui.png)
*Figure 1: The Em-Social UI, showing layout and sample data*

The Em-Social interface consists of five main sections:

1. **Household Panel** - Displays all households in your database
2. **Session Panel** - Shows sessions for the selected household
3. **Command Box** - Where you type commands
4. **Result Display** - Shows feedback from your commands  
  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #007ACC; padding: 0.75em 1em; background-color: #f0f8ff;">

üîç <strong>Before We Begin:</strong>

<ul>
  <li>For commands that do not take in parameters (<code>help</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>clear</code>, <code>exit</code>), additional text after the command will be <strong>ignored</strong>.<br>
  <em>e.g.</em> <code>help 123</code> will be processed as <code>help</code></li>

 <li>
    Command parameters can be provided in any order. For example, <code>add-s id/H0000002-2 d/2025-02-02 tm/18:18</code> is equivalent to <code>add-s id/H0000002-2 tm/18:18 d/2025-02-02</code>.
  </li>

  <li>For commands that do take in parameters, multiple instances of the same parameter are allowed. Except for tags, Em-Social will only process the <strong>last instance</strong> of the parameter. Multiple tags are allowed.<br>
  <em>e.g.</em> <code>add n/johnson n/robinson a/Tanglin Road p/91283882</code> will result in <code>robinson</code> being added as the household name, not <code>johnson</code></li>

  <li>To safeguard against accidental typos, double command words will result in the <strong>initial command</strong> being processed.<br>
  <em>e.g.</em> <code>edit edit id/H000001 n/Johnson</code> will be processed as <code>edit id/H000001 n/Johnson</code><br>
  <em>e.g.</em> <code>add edit n/Robertson a/Robinson Quay p/91283844</code> will be processed as <code>add n/Robertson a/Robinson Quay p/91283844</code></li>

  <li>  If a specific <a href="#-command-summary">parameter</a> is erroneous, the rest of the command will be ignored and the initial error will be displayed to you.<br>
  <em>e.g.</em> <code>add n/bert$ a/ p/</code> will return the error <code>Names may only contain alphanumeric characters or spaces, slashes (/), apostrophes ('), and dashes (-).</code> even though the empty <code>a/</code> and <code>p/</code> fields are also invalid.</li>
</ul>

</div>
  

## üè† Household Management

<div style="background-color: #FF6666; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #ff9900; margin-bottom: 10px;">
‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Warnings:</strong><br>
- If you edit a household to match an existing household, it will be rejected to prevent <a href="#-glossary">duplicate households</a>.<br>

</div>

<div style="background-color: #e6ffed; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #2ecc71; margin-bottom: 10px;">

‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Warning:</strong> Deleting a household will also delete <strong>all</strong> associated sessions. This action <strong>cannot</strong> be undone.
</div>

<br>

---

### Find households
You can search for households with the `find` command.

```

**Parameters:**
- `KEYWORD`: Search term to match against 
  - Household names
  - Addresses
  - Tags
- `""`: (double quotes) for exact phrase matching (e.g "Tan Family")

**Example of usage:**
```
find Tan Lee
```
- This finds the Households that include the keywords "Tan" and "Lee".


![find-without-quotes](images/find-without-quotes.png)

<div style="background-color: #e6ffed; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #2ecc71; margin-bottom: 10px;">

<div style="background-color: #e6ffed; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #2ecc71; margin-bottom: 10px;">
üí°<strong>Tips:</strong><br>
- The search is case-insensitive and matches partial words. For example, if you look for "Tan", it will match "Tan Family" and "Tanaka".<br>

## üí° Make the Most out of Em-Social

1. **Tagging Strategy**
   - Consider tags for case type (e.g. `financial`, `medical`, `housing`)
   - Use tags for priority levels (e.g. `urgent`, `follow-up`, `completed`)
   - Consider tagging households by location to minimize travel time (e.g. `north`, `west`, `central`)

2. **Session Planning**
   - Use the find command with tags to identify nearby cases (e.g. `find north`)
   - Use the [view-s](#view-household-sessions) command to review your upcoming schedule with a specific household

3. **Note-Taking**
   - Add detailed notes immediately after sessions while details are fresh
   - Add time estimates to session notes for better future planning
  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ü§î Frequently Asked Questions

‚ùì**Q: Can I import data from other case management systems?**  
‚úÖA: Currently, Em-Social doesn't support direct imports. You'll need to manually enter household information.

‚ùì**Q: How many households can Em-Social handle?**  
‚úÖA: Em-Social can efficiently manage hundreds of households, though performance may decrease with extremely large datasets (1000+).

‚ùì**Q: Is my data secure?**  
‚úÖA: Em-Social stores all data locally on your computer. No data is sent to external servers. For sensitive data, ensure your computer is secured with a password and consider encrypting your drive.

‚ùì**Q: Can multiple social workers use Em-Social simultaneously?**  
‚úÖA: Em-Social is designed for individual use. For team settings, each social worker should use their own instance of the application.

‚ùì**Q: What happens if I accidentally delete a household?**  
‚úÖA: Unfortunately, there's no built-in recovery for deleted households. This is why Em-Social always asks for confirmation before deletion. 

‚ùì**Q: Why am I unable to create multiple households with the same name?**  
‚úÖA: By preventing households with the same name or phone number from being saved, Em-Social ensures you save household details while **minimizing ambiguity**.  

‚ùì**Q: Why am I able to edit sessions to past dates?**  
‚úÖA: We understand that there are times when sessions with the households may be rearranged and not recorded. So, Em-Social provides this functionality to ensure that you can rearrange sessions at your own pace.

‚ùì**Q: Why am I able to add sessions one minute apart?**  
‚úÖA: As social workers, your sessions could vary from quickly giving out hampers to a more extensive check-in session, so we leave the duration to you!

‚ùì**Q: How do I report bugs or request features?**  
‚úÖA: Please submit issues on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/issues).
