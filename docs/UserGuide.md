## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Warnings**
Em-Social performs certain actions that cannot be undone once confirmed. Please take note of the following:
   - ⚠️ **Deleting a household or session is irreversible.**
   - ⚠️ **Using the `clear` command will remove all data from the system.** Only use it if you're sure you want to start fresh.
   - The system does not prompt for confirmation when editing data, so always double-check your input before submitting.

2. **Tagging Strategy**
   - Use consistent tags across households for better organization
   - Consider tags for case type (e.g., `financial`, `medical`, `housing`)
   - Use tags for priority levels (e.g., `urgent`, `follow-up`, `completed`)
   - Add tags for special needs (e.g., `elderly`, `children`, `disability`)

3. **Session Planning**
   - Schedule sessions at least 30 minutes apart to allow for travel time
   - Add detailed notes immediately after sessions while details are fresh
   - Use the list-sessions command to review your upcoming schedule

4. **Data Management**
   - While Em-Social automatically saves data to a local file after each command, consider:
   - Regularly backing up your data file (located at `data/householdbook.json`)
   - Creating separate backups for different periods (monthly/quarterly)

5. **Efficient Workflows**
   - Group visits by geographic area to minimize travel time
   - Use the find command with area names to identify nearby cases
   - Add time estimates to session notes for better future planning

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I import data from other case management systems?**
A: Currently, Em-Social doesn't support direct imports. You'll need to manually enter household information.

**Q: How many households can Em-Social handle?**
A: Em-Social can efficiently manage hundreds of households, though performance may decrease with extremely large datasets (1000+).

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Em-Social stores all data locally on your computer. No data is sent to external servers. For sensitive data, ensure your computer is secured with a password and consider encrypting your drive.

**Q: Can multiple social workers use Em-Social simultaneously?**
A: Em-Social is designed for individual use. For team settings, each social worker should use their own instance of the application.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally delete a household?**
A: Unfortunately, there's no built-in recovery for deleted households. This is why Em-Social asks for confirmation before deletion. Consider regular backups of your data file.

**Q: Can I customize the fields for households?**
A: The current version has fixed fields. Future versions may include customizable fields based on user feedback.

**Q: How do I report bugs or request features?**
A: Please submit issues on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/issues).
