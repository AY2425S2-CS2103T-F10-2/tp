**Em-Social is a desktop application designed to streamline scheduling and household management for social service workers!** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Em-Social, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md#-quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.
